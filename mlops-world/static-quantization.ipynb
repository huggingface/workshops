    "# Static Quantization example with `optimum` for `distilbert`\n",
    "\n",
    "In this session, you will learn how to do post-training static quantization on Hugging Face Transformers model. The session will show you how to quantize a DistilBERT model using [Hugging Face Optimum](https://huggingface.co/docs/optimum/index) and [ONNX Runtime](https://onnxruntime.ai/). Hugging Face Optimum is an extension of 🤗 Transformers, providing a set of performance optimization tools enabling maximum efficiency to train and run models on targeted hardware.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: Static quantization is currently only supported for CPUs, so we will not be utilizing GPUs / CUDA in this session. By the end of this session, you see how quantization with Hugging Face Optimum can result in significant increase in model latency while keeping almost 100% of the full-precision model. Furthermore, you’ll see how to easily apply some advanced quantization and optimization techniques shown here so that your models take much less of an accuracy hit than they would otherwise. \n",

    "\n",
    "We successfully quantized our vanilla Transformers model with Hugging Face and managed to accelerate our model latency from 75.69ms to 26.75ms or 2.83x while keeping 99.72% of the accuracy. \n",
    "\n",
    "But this i have to say that this isn't a plug and play process you can transfer to any Transformers model, task and dataset. The challenge with static quantization ist the calibration of the dataset to find the right ranges which you can use to quantize the model achieve good performance. I ran a hyperparameter search to find the best ranges for our dataset and quantized model using the [run_static_quantizatio_hpo.py](https://github.com/philschmid/optimum-static-quantization/blob/master/scripts/run_static_quantizatio_hpo.py). \n",
    "\n",
    "Also noteably to say it that static quantization can only achieve as good as results as dynamic quantization, but will be faster than dynamic quantization. Meaning that it might always be a good start to first dynamically quantize your model using Optimum and then move to static quantization for further latency and throughput gains. The attached repository also includes an example on how dynamically quantize the model [dynamic_quantization.py](https://github.com/philschmid/optimum-static-quantization/blob/master/scripts/dynamic_quantization.py)"
